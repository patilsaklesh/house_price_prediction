# House Price Prediction using XGBoost

This project predicts house prices based on various features using the XGBoost algorithm. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset and the relationship between different features and the target variable.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses using various features like area, number of rooms, location, etc. The dataset used contains several characteristics of houses, and the XGBoost model is applied to predict the house prices.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation
- **numpy**: For numerical operations
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization
- **xgboost**: For machine learning model implementation
- **sklearn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation


## Steps Involved

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section focuses on understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical analyses, including:
- Distribution of numerical features
- Correlation between features and target
- Handling missing data
- Identifying outliers

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

### 3. Model Training

- The XGBoost model is used to predict house prices.
- Hyperparameters are tuned using cross-validation for optimal performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction

## Results
The model will output the predicted house prices and display evaluation metrics like MSE and R².

## Future Improvements
Incorporate feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
Try additional models like Random Forest or Linear Regression to compare results.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
